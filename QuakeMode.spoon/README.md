# Quake Mode

The name refers to the developer console popping out on the screen when pressing the bound key, `~` (tilde) by default, in the Quake video game.
See [the quake-mode GNOME extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1411/quake-mode), for example.

This Spoon doesnâ€™t attempt to replicate the dropdown behaviour.
It toggles the application into/out of focus, regardless of the window count, their position, or size.
